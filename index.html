          Early education for upper caste males in India commenced under the
          supervision of a guru or prabhu. The education was delivered through
          Gurukula. The relationship between Guru and his Shishya (students
          /diciples) was very important part of the education. Takshasila (in
          modern-day Pakistan) is one of the example of ancient higher learning
          institute in India from possibly 8th century BCE, however, it is
          debatable whether it could be regarded a university or not in modern
          sense, since teachers living there may not have had official
          membership of particular colleges, and there did not seem to have
          existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in a
          Taxila, in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India.
          Nalanda was the oldest university-system of education in the world in
          the modern sense of university. There all subjects were taught in
          Ariano -PÃ¡li language.

          Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education
          system, which fall under the command of the government at three
          levels: central, state and local. Under various articles of the Indian
          Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory
          Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a
          fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of
          public schools to private schools in India is 7:5.

          Learning is the process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge,
          behaviors, skills, values, attitudes, and preferences.The ability
          to learn is possessed by humans, animals, and some machines; there is
          also evidence for some kind of learning in certain plants.Some
          learning is immediate, induced by a single event (e.g. being burned by
          a hot stove), but much skill and knowledge accumulate from repeated
          experiences. The changes induced by learning often last a lifetime,
          and it is hard to distinguish learned material that seems to be "lost"
          from that which cannot be retrieved.
